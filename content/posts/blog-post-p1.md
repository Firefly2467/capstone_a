## Forming the team, and thinking about the big picture
#### Posted 2023-09-12 | Next Post: [Searching for Problems...](https://posturemax.uwtron.xyz/posts/problem_search/ "Second blog post, details the process used for finding our project goals")

Without a concrete idea in mind for our capstone project, it was important to build a team that could tackle any challenge! Having a mix of software, electrical and mechanical experience would set the team up for success, but more importantly, each member would have to get along with one another, trust in each other, and share a common vision for the direction of the project.

Before understanding the design process, and the needs statement, we needed to understand the interests/hobbies/personal projects and skills of every potential team member, and after talking to many different groups and fellow students we created the project team with:

- Rohan:
  - Personal skills and Co-op experience include Firmware and Embedded knowledge, providing the team with a useful ressource for low-level electronics hardware and programming.
- Arjun:
  - Co-op experience with Software Control, Drones and Machine Learning, providing the team with the required background for robot control and software integrations.
- Anmol:
  - Co-op experience with high-level Software application development, AI hardware accelerators and training, expanding the team's access and technical background into AI integrations.
- John:
  - Personal project experience with mechanical design, 3D printing and electronics prototyping, supporting the team in achieving rapid prototyping goals.

With a broad skillset, we felt confident the team could take on any challenge.
